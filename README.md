# wage-level-calc
Imigration wage level calculation

# Purpose
Allows one to calculate the appropriate wage for an imigrent visa 
I think its H1B visa, can't remember

# Why?
My girlfriend is a paralegal and this makes her day easier

# macOS zip (.app) file location?
src/dist/"Wage Calc.zip"

# Will it be updated or ported?
Most likely not because I think it works and she uses macOS.
But you can compile the src for yourself to any paltform using pyinstaller

# Required packages to compile from src
-PyQt5
-pyinstaller
